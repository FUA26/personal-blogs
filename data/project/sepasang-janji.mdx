## Summary

Sepasang Janji is a startup that I founded in 2019. Specifically, in August 2019, it was launched to the public in December 2019. I put all my abilities into this project, ranging from managing the product, marketing, customer service, to coding. Overall, this project is technically the result of my hard work, of course, with various inputs from partners and clients. In March 2023, I had to put this project on hold due to the high workload of my main job.

### Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to create a blueprint for several projects that will be interconnected in the future. At the beginning, I aimed to solve the problem of how to make wedding invitations more modern and easy. As time went by, in early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic emerged, and this project was able to run and became popular. Based on input from several clients, the scope was expanded to include gifts, QR codes, and other features.

### Problems

The first problem that arose was time. While this project was running, I had to share my time with my main job. This caused me to only be able to serve a few of the interested parties. This had an impact on slow development.

The first problem combined with the Covid-19 pandemic caused more competitors to emerge. At the beginning of the development phase, market research was conducted.

The first problem, combined with the pandemic, caused the web invitation market to be very good. Where if the market is good, it will certainly attract other service providers, this makes the number of interested parties decrease because they move to competitors. Next, it can be guessed that an extraordinary price war occurred.

## Lessons Learned

In this project, I learned many valuable things. The first lesson is how, with all my limitations, I can provide something that can help others. In this project, I learned about how to manage a product from top to bottom.
